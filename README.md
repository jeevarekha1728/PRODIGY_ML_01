## Introduction
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. The primary feature used for prediction is the square footage of the house. The model is trained and evaluated using a dataset from Kaggle and implemented in a Google Colab notebook.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle.

Dataset- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashydv/housing-dataset

It contains various features related to houses, including their square footage and corresponding prices.

## Model
The model uses a simple linear regression algorithm to predict house prices based on square footage. The steps involved include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing the relationship between square footage and house prices.
Model Training: Training a linear regression model on the dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
## Results
The results of the model are evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared. The trained model demonstrates the relationship between square footage and house prices, providing reasonable predictions.
